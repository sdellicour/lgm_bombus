80000 year ice sheet reconstruction at 2500 year intervals

When making some plots of the ice sheets, I found an issue where the ice thickness in Alaska was cut off. This was caused by some confusion in how the Generic Mapping Tools handles conversion from projected to geographical coordinates. This affected the paleotopography and ice thickness values in the geographical grids only in Alaska. The corrected grids are now uploaded into global_grid/

Note that the geographical grids found in global_grid/ had a problem when I originally created them. This was due to a mistake I made in converting the Antarctic ice thickness grid from polar projected coordinates to geographical coordinates. I have changed how I did the conversion, so it is now fixed. These geographical grids were not used in evaluating the reconstruction, only the projected grids. Many thanks to Jacky Austermann for notifying me of this problem.

If you need any help with these files, please contact me (evan.gowan@awi.de or evangowan@gmail.com), and I will do my best to aid you.

If you would like to do manipulation of the ice sheet reconstruction, make sure to check out ICESHEET 2.0, which can be downloaded from the following Github repository:

https://github.com/evangowan/icesheet

The files in this folder were created and/or designed to be used with Generic Mapping Tools version 5 (http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/). If you would like to use the NetCDF files here in other programs, you may need to modify the header records of the files using tools like nco.


There are two reconstructions of MIS 3 for North America. One is a minimal scenario, where at one point Hudson Bay becomes ice free. The second, maximal scenario, has extensive ice cover across Hudson Bay throughout MIS 3. In this archive, any files associated with the maximal scenario have "a1" appended to them.

In addition, if you want to compare the results of the calculated sea level to sea level proxies, I have uploaded some documents at the following address:

ice_reconstruction_files/
#####################################

This folder contains the raw, 5 km resolution ice sheet reconstructions generated by ICESHEET. This folder includes the deformed base topography, ice thickness, and paleo-topography files, as netCDF files in a projected coordinate system. The details of the coordinate system can be found in the "projected_info.sh" file, which can be read into a Generic Mapping Tools plotting script. If you want to use these files for other purposes (i.e. comparing adjacent time steps for changes in elevation), I strongly recommend smoothing them, for instance with a 20-25 km radius average. See the script in global_grid/ for a way to do this.

Each folder contains:

deform/ - contains the deformation/sea level change relative to present, calculated from SELEN
modern_topo/ - contains a projected 5 km grid of modern day, subglacial topography from RTOPO-2. Note for North America, I have also subtracted off the ice thickness for the Agassiz and Barnes Ice Caps using NASA ICEBRIDGE radar data (Leuschen et al, updated 2017. IceBridge MCoRDS L2 Ice Thickness, Version 1. Boulder, Colorado USA. NASA National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center,http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/GDQ0CUCVTE2Q), and the Devon Ice Cap using data from Dowdeswell et al 2004 (Form and flow of the Devon Island Ice Cap, Canadian Arctic - Journal of Geophysical Research). RTOPO-2 also includes the bathymetry of the Great Lakes, so I had to subtract the equavelent amount of ice from the ice thickness values
topo/ - paleotopography, with the ice sheet calculated using ICESHEET. Subtract the ice thickness to get the subglacial topography
thickness/ - ice thickness, which was calculated by subtracting the topo NetCDF files from the sum of the deform and modern_topo files.
projected_info.sh - information on the projection used for the NetCDF files
volume_sorted.txt - Time series of the ice volume (km^3), ice volume (10^6 km^3), and equivalent sea level (assuming the modern ocean area of 361x10^6 km^2 and an ice density of 910 kg/m^3)

margins/
#####################################

This folder contains the reconstructed ice margins, in the GMT text format (https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/gmt.html), in geographical coordinates. These files can be converted to shapefiles using ogr2ogr, or directly read in with QGIS. See the enclosed readme files to see the resources and philosophy of generating these margin files.

For North America, there are two scenarios, one with a collapse of the ice sheet within Hudson Bay (the minimal scenario in the paper), and one labeled "a1", in which the ice sheet covers Hudson Bay throughout MIS 3 (the maximal scenario in the paper).


#####################################
deformation/
#####################################

This zip files contains 1 and 0.25 degree resolution deformation calculated by SELEN that was used to generate the ice sheet reconstructions presented in the ice_reconstruction_files/ folder. If you want to use this to regenerate the ice sheet reconstructions, place it in the global/deform/ folder in ICESHEET 2.0. A description is as follows:

icesheet_Evan_ehgr_71_67_64_65.dat.zip           - "minimal" North America MIS 3 scenario at 1 degree
icesheet_Evan_ehgr_71_67_64_65_quarter.dat.zip   - "minimal" North America MIS 3 scenario at 0.25 degree
icesheet_Evan_ehgr_78_79_80_81.zip               - "maximal" North America MIS 3 scenario at 1 degree
icesheet_Evan_ehgr_78_79_80_81_quarter.zip       - "maximal" North America MIS 3 scenario at 0.25 degree


#####################################
calc_sl/
#####################################

This folder contains a program that will allow you to calculate sea level anywhere around the world, or to create a global grid. This program was written for SELEN (Spada and Stocchi, 2007), and is under a GNU General Public License version 3. The spherical harmonics coefficients included here were also used to calculate the file in deformation/. Please read the readme file for more information.

#####################################
global_grid/
#####################################

This folder contains the paleo-topography and ice thickness grids at 0.25 and 1 degree resolutions. Also included is a script (create_global_grid.sh) that can be used to generate grids at whatever resolution you want. The folder Canada_ice_thickness/ contains the ice thickness for Canadian ice caps, including the Agassiz, Devon and Barnes, which are subtracted off of the global Rtopo-2 grid. The folder Rtopo-2/ contains the script that generates the finer resolution versions of Rtopo-2.

#####################################
global_paleotopo_plots/
#####################################

Global paleo-topography maps generated for every time step. Also included are relative sea level contour plots. Generated using the "plots.sh" script in the global_grid/ folder.

#####################################
local_plots/
#####################################

This folder contains higher resolution plots of paleo-topography, ice thickness and basal shear stress in local projected coordinates. These plots are generated after running ICESHEET.

#####################################
Stokes_Coefficients
#####################################

This folder contains the Stokes coefficients, calculated to 256 degrees, for all of the tested Earth model-ice sheet combinations described in the paper.
